## opendoas-sudo
A symlink for using [Doas](https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas) as a drop-in replacement for sudo.

This package has been removed from the Arch User Repository (AUR) for some reason, but you can still see it [with a link](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/?h=opendoas-sudo&id=dd0558b5553d79b825964fdbdf8af3e53787bad1), [this link](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/aur-dd0558b5553d79b825964fdbdf8af3e53787bad1.tar.gz) will download the last commit.

I also uploaded the PKGBUILD and .SRCINFO here.
